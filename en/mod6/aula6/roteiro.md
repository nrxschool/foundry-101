# **Lesson 6: Advanced Testing**  

## **1. Introduction**  

In this lesson, we will explore **testing methodologies in smart contract development**, focusing on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and the importance of testing in **Web3** applications. Specifically, we will dive into **Fuzz Testing**, a powerful technique that helps identify unexpected behaviors in contracts. Additionally, we will cover the use of **cheatcodes** and how to interpret test results.  

📌 **What we will cover today:**  
1️⃣ What is TDD and why is testing important in Web3?  
2️⃣ Fuzz Testing.  
3️⃣ Cheatcodes.  
4️⃣ Interpreting results.

## **2. What is TDD and Why is Testing Important in Web3?**  

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a methodology that prioritizes writing tests **before developing the code**. This ensures that each new functionality is validated, resulting in more **robust and reliable** code.  

In Web3, where smart contracts handle **valuable assets and are exposed to potential attacks**, rigorous testing is **critical**.  

✅ **Benefits of testing in smart contract development:**  
- Ensures the **contract behaves as expected** under different conditions.  
- Prevents **security vulnerabilities** and unintended behavior.  
- Increases **confidence** for developers and users before deployment.

## **3. Fuzz Testing**  

📌 **What is Fuzz Testing?**  

**Fuzz Testing** is a technique that generates **random test inputs** to explore edge cases that could cause failures or unexpected behavior in a contract. Foundry's testing framework (**Forge**) provides built-in support for fuzz testing.  

### **📌 Example: Fuzz Testing in Foundry**  

Let's examine a simple contract and see how we can turn a unit test into a **property-based test using fuzzing**:  

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract Safe {
    receive() external payable {}

    function withdraw() external {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

contract SafeTest is Test {
    Safe safe;
    address alice;

    receive() external payable {}

    function setUp() public {
        safe = new Safe();
    }

    function test_Withdraw() public {
        payable(address(safe)).transfer(1 ether);
        uint256 preBalance = address(this).balance;
        safe.withdraw();
        uint256 postBalance = address(this).balance;
        assertEq(preBalance + 1 ether, postBalance);
    }

    function testFuzz_Withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        vm.assume(amount > 0.1 ether && amount < 10000 ether);

        vm.deal(alice, amount);
        vm.prank(alice);
        payable(address(safe)).transfer(amount);
        uint256 preBalance = address(this).balance;
        safe.withdraw();
        uint256 postBalance = address(this).balance;
        assertEq(preBalance + amount, postBalance);
    }
}
```

📌 **How it works:**  
- **`test_Withdraw`** → A basic test with a fixed input (1 ether).  
- **`testFuzz_Withdraw`** → Uses **random values** for `amount`.  
- **`vm.assume(amount > 0.1 ether && amount < 10000 ether);`** → Filters out invalid test cases.  

✅ **Running fuzz tests:**  

```bash
forge test --fuzz-runs 1000
```

✅ **Forge will run the test 1,000 times with different values to uncover unexpected issues.**  

---

## **4. Cheatcodes**  

📌 **What are cheatcodes?**  

**Cheatcodes** are special functions available in Foundry that allow developers to **manipulate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) state** during testing.  

📌 **Commonly used cheatcodes:**  
- **`vm.assume(condition);`** → Filters out inputs that don't meet a condition.  
- **`vm.prank(address);`** → Simulates a function call from a specific address.  
- **`vm.deal(address, amount);`** → Sets an account's balance.  

### **📌 Example: Using Cheatcodes in Fuzz Tests**  

```solidity
function testFuzz_Withdraw(uint96 amount) public {
    vm.assume(amount > 0); // Ignore invalid values
    // ...
}
```

✅ **Cheatcodes help simulate different blockchain states to test edge cases efficiently.**

## **5. Interpreting Fuzz Testing Results**  

📌 **Understanding fuzz test outputs:**  

- **"Runs"** → Number of times the fuzz test executed. (Default: 256 runs)  
- **"μ" (mu)** → Average gas used per test execution.  
- **"~" (tilde)** → Median gas used across executions.  

📌 **Example output:**  

```
[PASS] testFuzz_Withdraw(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 21,000, ~: 20,500)
```

✅ **What this tells us:**  
- The test ran **256 times** with random inputs.  
- The **average gas cost** was **21,000**.  
- The **median gas cost** was **20,500**.

## **6. Configuring Fuzz Testing Parameters**  

📌 **You can adjust fuzz testing parameters in Foundry:**  

- **Increase the number of test runs:**  

```bash
forge test --fuzz-runs 5000
```

- **Adjust randomness and input constraints:**  

Modify the test logic using `vm.assume()`.
